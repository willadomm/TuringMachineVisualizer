An interactive script that simulates what some common recursive languages look like on a Turing Machine tape. Currently, just prints out in the terminal, but I have plans to add more graphics. All TM transition deltas are my own. 

Next Steps:

Adding a state transition flowchart using graphviz or something similar 

Making my tape graphics a bit better, maybe using pygame

Adding the ability to make a custom TM

Adding the ability to input TMs on the tape, for simulating recursively enumerable languages as well

Letting the user go backward through steps, for more clarity in how the string is shaped on the tape. 


To run, run main.py
